I am the founder of [Base26 Labs](https://base26labs.com/). 
We bridge code-heavy traditional software with data-heavy AI methods to solve digital-to-physical translation problems.

Previously, I was an assistant professor of computer science at San Francisco State University (SFSU). I completed my PhD at Harvard, advised by Professor Greg Morrisett, and have been fortunate to collaborate with mentors like Professor Dawn Song (UC Berkeley) and Jean-Baptiste Tristan (AWS). My academic research spanned AI, programming languages/formal methods, and quantum computing.
