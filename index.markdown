I am the founder of [Base26 Labs](https://base26labs.com/) where we explore the convergence of language, data, and executable code.
Our current focus is the development of neuro-symbolic AI, spanning the spectrum from neural perception to symbolic reasoning, to apply digital intelligence to physical-world problems.

Previously, I was an assistant professor of computer science at San Francisco State University (SFSU).
I completed my PhD at Harvard, advised by Professor Greg Morrisett, and have been fortunate to collaborate with mentors like Professor Dawn Song (UC Berkeley) and Jean-Baptiste Tristan (AWS).
My academic research spanned AI, programming languages/formal methods, and quantum computing.
