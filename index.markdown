I run [Base26 Labs](mailto:info@base26labs.com). 
We build custom AI systems that fuse perception and reasoning (i.e., neurosymbolic AI) to enhance reliablility and interpretability.

I am currently on leave from San Francisco State University (SFSU) where I was an assistant professor of computer science.

In the past, I have been fortunate to work with Professor Dawn Song (at UC Berkeley), Jean-Baptiste Tristan
(at AWS), and Professor Greg Morrisett for my PhD (at Harvard).

I have worked on topics in AI, programming/formal languages, and quantum computing.
