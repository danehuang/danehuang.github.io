I am the founder of [Base26 Labs](https://base26labs.com/) where we are building the future of neuro-symbolic AI.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between 'Software 1.0' (code-heavy traditional logic) and 'Software 2.0' (data-heavy neural methods) to solve problems where digital intelligence meets the physical world.

Previously, I was an assistant professor of computer science at San Francisco State University (SFSU).
I completed my PhD at Harvard, advised by Professor Greg Morrisett, and have been fortunate to collaborate with mentors like Professor Dawn Song (UC Berkeley) and Jean-Baptiste Tristan (AWS).
My academic research spanned AI, programming languages/formal methods, and quantum computing.
