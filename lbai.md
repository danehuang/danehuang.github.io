While at SFSU, I lead the **Language-Based AI** Lab.
Our aim was to bridge the well-studied world of programming with *code*, i.e., using a *language*,
with new ways of programming with *data*, i.e., using AI/ML.
As software becomes increasingly data-driven, new techniques are required to build, reason about, and verify these hybrid systems.


We studied uncertainty quantification of deep learning systems (to reason about AI systems, [[Push]](https://lbai-push.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), function approximation with derivative information (to enable new applications in science, [[DCNN]](https://github.com/lbai-lab/dcnn-training)), neuro-symbolic systems (to understand the mixing of code and data), and adiabatic quantum computing (to leverage new hardware, [[a2c]](https://adiabatic-compiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
