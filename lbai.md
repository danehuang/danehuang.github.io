I lead the **Language-Based AI** Lab at SFSU.
Our aim is to bridge the well-studied world of programming with *code*, i.e., using a *language*,
with new ways of programming with *data*, i.e., using AI/ML.
As programs shift from being comprised largely of code to being increasingly comprised of data, we will need new techniques to reason and build such programs.


We study uncertainty quantification of deep learning systems (to reason about AI systems, [[Push]](https://lbai-push.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), function approximation with derivative information (to enable new applications in science, [[DCNN]](https://github.com/lbai-lab/dcnn-training)), neuro-symbolic systems (to understand the mixing of code and data), and adiabatic quantum computing (to leverage new hardware, [[a2c]](https://adiabatic-compiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
